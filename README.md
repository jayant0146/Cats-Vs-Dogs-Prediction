# Cats-Vs-Dogs-Prediction
> Implemented the Simple classification algorithm over the dataset:
> [Link of the Kaggle DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data).

## Installing Required Packages
- `numpy` : To handle the dataset
- `matplotlib` : To plot the graphs
- `cv2` : Used to handle image operations
- `Tensorflow` : Backened of Keras
- `Keras` : Used to implement the CNN
- `os` : provides functions for creating and removing a directory (folder), fetching its contents, changing and identifying the current directory, etc.

### How the Model Works?
> The dataset contains a lot of images of cats and dogs. The aim is to make the model learn the distinguishing features between the cat and dog. Once the model has learned, i.e once the model got trained, it will be able to classify the input image as either cat or a dog.
